# Chinook_Database_Udacity

Project made as part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

The project explore the database from a virtual music store named chinook to get insight and answer questions, proposed by me, related to customers and purchase.

The data was retrieved from the database using SQL query and export to spreadsheet application to build the visualizations on the insight report.
